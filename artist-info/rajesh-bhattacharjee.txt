Rajesh Bhattacharjee
Rajesh Bhattacharjee is a landscape photographer based in Pittsburgh, USA.  He is a scientist by profession and photographer by passion. Whenever he manages some free time, he gets out in the field to hear the sound of a rushing stream, to see the last light on the mountains and to feel the crushing waves of the ocean.
In his youth, Rajesh was in complete veneration for the mighty Himalayas and her verdant valleys. He cherished the times spent in the lofty heights of the Himalayas and always wanted to capture those moments of tranquil beauty and fleeting light. Thus his passion for landscape photography was born. Later in 2007 he moved to USA and shifted to the digital medium for his landscapes. For him it has since then been a pleasurable and adventurous journey  through the wilderness of the US. Nothing gives him more joy than the hikes through rugged terrains and landscapes from dawn till dusk, waiting for that perfect light and colour.
