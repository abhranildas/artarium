Tejal Akolkar
Born in Pune to Lalita and Jay Akolkar, Tejal studied physiotherapy for some years although her burning desire was to become an artist. Magic flowed from her gifted hands as she produced extraordinary sketches, paintings and origami in between her work and academics. On 19 December 2011, two months before she would complete her physiotherapy degree and look to start her training in art, Tejal passed away in a road accident on her way to work. She was twenty-two. Her loved ones remember her as quiet, thoughtful and intense, a person of exceptional talent they were proud to have in their lives.</p><p>During her lifetime, Tejal's artwork never found a befitting platform. Through her gallery here at Artarium, Tejal shall always remain amidst her audience, her loving pencil strokes preserved forever in time, the magical touch of her fingers never to be forgotten.
