Binayak Dasgupta
Brought up in metropolitan Singapore, Binayak is a city boy through and through. The photographic subjects that interest him most are therefore the lines and colours of urban landscapes and city skylines. Still claiming himself to be a learning amateur, he is always looking to try his hand at fresh ideas and techniques, and to push the boundaries of his photographic expression.
